# CGE

CGE (Core Game Engine) is a Game Engine focused on core features and performance. 
It is written in C++ and uses OpenGL for rendering.

## Current Features
- Simple Rendering
- Input Handling

I know, pretty embarrassing. But I'm working on it while having school for 9:30 hours a day AND learning Engine Architecture, so please be patient.

## Planned Features
- ECS (Entity Component System)
- Scene Management
- UI System

### Currently working on:
- ECS

### Notes:
The renderer currently initializes a VAO and VBO for a simple triangle.
This will be changed in the future. The Renderer WILL NOT own the VAO and VBO.

## Building the Engine
### Prerequisites
- Make
- g++ (C++ compiler)
- OpenGL
- glfw3
- glew
- glm
